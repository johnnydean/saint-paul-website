<h1>Blog about Saint Paul</h1>
<h2>Blog 1</h2>
<p>Hello readers, this is Johnny. The topic I will be writing about today is Saint Paul, and how anyone can relate to him. I personally think that the story of the conversion of Saint Paul shows that you can not judge someone for what they have done in the past. In Paulâ€™s case, some people were very surprised when Paul began preaching, but they got used to it. In the life of younger kids if someone does not share toys one day, but they do the next, other kids will still share toys with them, most of the time. However, In the life of teenagers, if someone was to make fun of you for about a week, and then later apologize, it can take months in some cases for people to regain trust. The same can be true with adults. One thing leads to a lasting grudge, even after that thing has stopped. I personally think that we should be more open to apologies as we get farther into life, and that we all make sure we do not hold grudges.</p>

<p>Hello, I am back to discuss more about the life of Saint Paul. A lot of times Paul is labeled as two things. Some people know him as that guy who hated the church, saw Jesus, became blind, and then liked the church. Some people know him as the guy who wrote letters that are in the bible today. Some people know him as both. These descriptions, while correct, leave out so many of the interesting details of his life. Most people believe his name was Saul until he was converted, where it became Paul. This is actually false. He had two names at birth, one Saul, one Paul. As a roman citizen he was known as Saul, his name for the first half of his life. Not until few decades after being converted did he start going by Paul. Before conversion, he was known for persecuting christians and he actually took part in the stoning of the first christian martyr. There is much more information about Saint Paul than the general populous knows about.</p>
